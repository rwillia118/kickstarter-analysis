# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The overview of this project is to analyze and understand which fund-raising campaigns are most successful with reaching their funding goals within a specific amount of time.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help Louise understand how her play could reach the funding goal by comparing her Play to previous fund-raising campaigns which met their goals by a specific launch date.

## Analysis and Challenges
The challenges that I ran into reviewing the data was making sure that the formulas were placed into the cells correctly. I found that this was an issue because I ran into a lot of error when I did not fully read the entire formula before it was submitted into a cell. To resolve this issue, I would have to do a Google search to ensure that the formula that I was putting has the correct commas or parentheses.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
After analyzing the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch data, we can conclude that the most successful time of the year for a Theater campaign is in the Second Business Quarter of the year with May being the most successful Month. Also, we can conclude that the Fourth Business Quarter of the year has the highest failed Campaigns with October having the most failed Theater campaigns.
