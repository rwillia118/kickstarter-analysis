# Crowd funding Analysis Report

## Overview of Project
The overview of this project is to analyze and understand which fund-raising campaigns are most successful with reaching their funding goals within a specific amount of time. Also 
the purpose of this project is to help Louise understand how her play could reach the funding goal by comparing her Play to previous fund-raising campaigns which met their goals by a specific launch date.

## Analysis and Challenges
The challenges that I ran into was making sure that the formulas were placed into the cells correctly. I found that this was an issue because I ran into a lot of errors when I did not fully read the entire formula before it was submitted into a cell. To resolve this issue, I did a Google search to ensure that the formula that I was putting has the correct commas or parentheses. After reviewing the data I see that Theater events are the most succesful event at reaching the funding goals and the best time in the year to have a Theater fund raising event would be in the Second Quarter of the year.
