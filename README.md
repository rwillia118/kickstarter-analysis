# Crowd funding Analysis Report

## Overview of Project
The overview of this project is to analyze and understand which fund-raising campaigns are most successful with reaching their funding goals within a specific amount of time. Also 
the purpose of this project is to help Louise understand how her play could reach the funding goal by comparing her Play to previous fund-raising campaigns which met their goals by a specific launch date.

## Analysis and Challenges
The challenges that I ran into was making sure that the formulas were placed into the cells correctly. I found that this was an issue because I ran into a lot of errors when I did not fully read the entire formula before it was submitted into a cell. To resolve this issue, I did a Google search to ensure that the formula that I was putting has the correct commas or parentheses. After reviewing the data I see that Theater events are the most succesful event at reaching the funding goals and the best time in the year to have a Theater fund raising event would be in the Second Quarter of the year.

## Results

1. Whenever you have a Theater Event you have a higher chance of reaching your funding goal in between the months of April, May, and June. That is also when the majority of the Theater events are launched. We also see that towards the end of the year there is a decrease in the amount of Theater campaigns because the there is a greater chance that they do not reach the funding goal. 

2. We can conclude from the example below that the goal range from $1,000.00 to $4,999.00 has the best chance of sucession because that is the goal which most of the projects set and has one of the highest successful percentage rate.

3. Some additional charts could have been created to help determine the top ten Countries which had the highest funding goal within the last five years such as a bar graph or a pie graph. A few limitations that I came across while reviewing the dataset is we do not know the audiences or viewers. If the data for Theater or Play would have shown that the event was sold out it would have let us know if the location had anything to do with the campaign reaching its funding goal.
